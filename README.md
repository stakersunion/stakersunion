Welcome to the Stakers Union GitHub!

# Stakers Union
The home-stakers collective
Empowering individual stakers, preserving decentralization

## Verified Solo-Stakers
Weâ€™ve developed a robust, multi-step process to verify our members are solo-stakers, most of whom #StakeFromHome

## Growing Incentives
The role of solo-stakers cannot be overstated, help us combat the centralizing forces of liquid staking and restaking services to promote a healthier blockchain.

## Building Partnerships
Unlock the decentralized computation of our members for your project or application. Our active members are incentivized to provide high-uptime and performance.
